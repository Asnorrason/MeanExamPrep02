 Node.js, Express + JavaScript Backend Testing

#### Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform.
 
- Simple to use
- Package development like JQuery, Node, Angula 
- Donâ€™t have to compile

####Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using for example Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat

######Pros

- Simple to use, example:
 var express = require('express')

	var app = express()
	
	app.get('/', function (req, res) { res.send('Hello World') })
	
	app.listen(3000)
- Package Market evolves and updates everyday (Lots of package developers)

###### Cons

- You have to get middlewares from NPM. If it isnt a standard middleware, but something you havent used before, you have to look it up on the market before you install it, else you could end up with bad or old code.
